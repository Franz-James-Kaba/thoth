# Thoth QA Agent - AI Agent Installation Instructions

**Target Audience**: AI Agents (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
**Repository**: https://github.com/Franz-James-Kaba/toth
**Version**: 1.0.0

---

## Context

You are an AI agent being asked to install the Thoth QA Agent into a user's project. Thoth is a comprehensive QA automation agent with 10 workflows, 2 quick actions, and support for multiple testing frameworks (Selenium, Cypress, Appium, RestAssured).

---

## Prerequisites Check

Before proceeding, determine:
1. **Current working directory**: What is `pwd`?
2. **User's project root**: Where does the user want Thoth installed?
3. **Repository location**: Do you need to clone the repo or is it already available?

---

## Installation Steps (Execute Sequentially)

### STEP 1: Obtain Thoth Repository

**If repository not yet cloned:**

```bash
# Clone to a temporary location
git clone https://github.com/Franz-James-Kaba/toth.git /tmp/thoth-repo
```

**Repository structure you'll find:**
```
toth/
├── bmad/qa/          # This is the module to copy
│   ├── agents/
│   ├── workflows/
│   ├── config.yaml
│   ├── INSTALL.md
│   └── README.md
```

---

### STEP 2: Ask User for Installation Preferences

**REQUIRED**: Ask the user:

```
Question 1: Where would you like to install Thoth QA Agent?
  Option A: Project root as 'thoth-qa' (Recommended)
  Option B: .claude/thoth-qa
  Option C: tools/thoth-qa
  Option D: Custom location (please specify)

Question 2: What is your name? (for config.yaml personalization)

Question 3: What is your preferred language? (default: english)
```

**Store these values:**
- `INSTALL_PATH` = user's chosen installation path
- `USER_NAME` = user's name
- `USER_LANGUAGE` = user's preferred language

---

### STEP 3: Copy Module to Target Location

**Execute:**

```bash
# If cloned to /tmp/thoth-repo
cp -r /tmp/thoth-repo/bmad/qa $INSTALL_PATH

# Verify copy succeeded
ls -la $INSTALL_PATH/agents/thoth.md
ls -la $INSTALL_PATH/config.yaml
```

**Expected result:** All files copied successfully to `$INSTALL_PATH`

---

### STEP 4: Create Output Directories

**Execute:**

```bash
# Navigate to project root
cd {project-root}

# Create required output folders
mkdir -p qa-output/test-plans
mkdir -p qa-output/test-cases
mkdir -p qa-output/automation
mkdir -p qa-output/bug-reports
mkdir -p qa-output/test-results

# Verify creation
ls -la qa-output/
```

**Expected result:** 5 subdirectories created under `qa-output/`

---

### STEP 5: Customize Configuration

**Execute:**

```bash
# Read current config
cat $INSTALL_PATH/config.yaml
```

**Then update using Edit tool:**

Find and replace in `$INSTALL_PATH/config.yaml`:
- `user_name: 'Franzy'` → `user_name: '$USER_NAME'`
- `communication_language: 'english'` → `communication_language: '$USER_LANGUAGE'`

**Do NOT modify:**
- Output folder paths (they use `{project-root}` variables)
- Default framework settings (user can change later)

---

### STEP 6: Verify Installation

**Execute all verification commands:**

```bash
# Check agent file exists
test -f $INSTALL_PATH/agents/thoth.md && echo "✓ Agent file exists" || echo "✗ Agent file missing"

# Check config exists
test -f $INSTALL_PATH/config.yaml && echo "✓ Config exists" || echo "✗ Config missing"

# Check workflows exist
test -d $INSTALL_PATH/workflows/automation-generation && echo "✓ Workflows exist" || echo "✗ Workflows missing"

# Check output directories exist
test -d qa-output/automation && echo "✓ Output directories exist" || echo "✗ Output directories missing"

# Count workflow folders
ls -1 $INSTALL_PATH/workflows/ | wc -l
```

**Expected results:**
- All 4 checks show ✓
- 10 workflow folders found

---

### STEP 7: Test Thoth Activation

**Execute:**

Use the Read tool to load Thoth:
```
Read file: $INSTALL_PATH/agents/thoth.md
```

**Expected behavior:**
- You will see the full agent XML loaded
- Thoth persona and commands become active
- You should be able to respond with Thoth's identity

**Test command:**
After loading, respond to: "What commands do you have?"
You should list all 14 commands from Thoth's menu.

---

### STEP 8: Report Installation Success

**Provide user with:**

```markdown
## ✅ Thoth QA Agent Installation Complete!

**Installation Summary:**
- **Location**: $INSTALL_PATH
- **Workflows**: 10 total (5 production-ready, 5 expandable)
- **Output Directory**: qa-output/ (5 subdirectories)
- **Configuration**: Personalized for $USER_NAME

**Quick Start:**
1. Load Thoth: `Read file: $INSTALL_PATH/agents/thoth.md`
2. Try first command: `*help`
3. Test quick action: `*quick-bug`
4. Generate automation: `*generate-automation`

**Production-Ready Workflows:**
- *generate-automation - Test automation with POM
- *design-cases - Test case design
- *plan-tests - Test planning
- *report-bug - Bug reporting
- *analyze-results - Results analysis

**Quick Actions:**
- *quick-bug - Fast bug report
- *suggest-tests - Test suggestions

**Files Installed:**
- Agent: $INSTALL_PATH/agents/thoth.md
- Config: $INSTALL_PATH/config.yaml
- Workflows: $INSTALL_PATH/workflows/ (10 folders)
- Documentation: $INSTALL_PATH/README.md, INSTALL.md

**Next Steps:**
Would you like me to:
A) Load Thoth now and test it?
B) Generate your first automated test?
C) Explain any of Thoth's workflows?
```

## Error Handling

### If Step 1 fails (clone fails):
- Check if user has git installed: `git --version`
- Check internet connectivity
- Ask user if they can provide the repo as a zip file

### If Step 3 fails (copy fails):
- Check source path exists: `ls -la /tmp/thoth-repo/bmad/qa`
- Check target directory permissions: `ls -ld $INSTALL_PATH`
- Suggest using `sudo` if permissions issue

### If Step 4 fails (mkdir fails):
- Check if qa-output already exists: `ls -la qa-output/`
- If exists, ask user if they want to keep existing or recreate
- Check write permissions in project root

### If Step 5 fails (config edit fails):
- Verify config.yaml is readable: `cat $INSTALL_PATH/config.yaml`
- Try manual edit with user guidance
- Worst case: user can edit manually later

### If Step 7 fails (Thoth won't load):
- Verify file path is correct: `realpath $INSTALL_PATH/agents/thoth.md`
- Check file is not corrupted: `wc -l $INSTALL_PATH/agents/thoth.md` (should be ~140 lines)
- Try reading with absolute path instead of relative

---

## Key Variables Reference

Throughout installation, use these variable placeholders:

- `$INSTALL_PATH` = Where Thoth is installed (e.g., `thoth-qa`, `.claude/thoth-qa`)
- `$USER_NAME` = User's name for config personalization
- `$USER_LANGUAGE` = User's preferred language (default: english)
- `{project-root}` = Used in config.yaml, represents project root directory

---

## Important Notes for AI Agents

1. **Always ask before executing**: Show the user what commands you'll run before running them
2. **Use relative paths**: Prefer relative paths over absolute when possible
3. **Verify each step**: Don't proceed to next step if previous failed
4. **Read before edit**: Always use Read tool before Edit/Write tool
5. **Sequential execution**: These steps MUST be executed in order
6. **Report errors clearly**: If something fails, explain what happened and what to try next
7. **Test at the end**: Always try to load Thoth after installation to verify it works

---

## What Success Looks Like

After successful installation, you should be able to:

1. ✅ Load Thoth agent file without errors
2. ✅ See all 14 commands in Thoth's menu
3. ✅ Execute `*quick-bug` command successfully
4. ✅ Execute `*suggest-tests` command successfully
5. ✅ See personalized config with user's name
6. ✅ Confirm all 10 workflow folders exist
7. ✅ Confirm all 5 output directories exist
